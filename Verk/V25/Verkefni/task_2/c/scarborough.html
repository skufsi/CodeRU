    <p>Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
        Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
        Remember me to one who lives there
        she<br> once was a true love of mine</p>
    <p>Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
        Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
        Without no seams nor needle work
        Then<br> she'll be a true love of mine
    </p>
    <p>Tell her to find me an acre of land
        Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
        Between the salt water and the sea strands<br>
        Then she'll be a true love of mine</p>
