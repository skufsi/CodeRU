    <h1>Texti fyrir lagi√∞ Mull of Kintyre eftir Paul McCartney</h1>
    <p>Mull of Kintyre
        Oh, mist rolling in from the sea
        My desire is always to be here
        Oh, Mull of Kintyre</p>
    <p>Far have I traveled and much have I seen
        Dark distant mountains with valleys of green
        Past painted deserts, the sunset's on fire
        As he carries me home to the Mull of Kintyre</p>
