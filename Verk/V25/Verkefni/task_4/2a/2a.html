    <p>Sir James Paul McCartney (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter and musician who gained
        worldwide fame with the Beatles, for whom he played bass guitar and the piano, and shared primary
        songwriting and lead vocal duties with John Lennon. One of the most successful composers and performers of
        all time, McCartney is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing, versatile and wide tenor vocal range,
        and musical eclecticism, exploring genres ranging from pre-rock and roll pop to classical, ballads, and
        electronica. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most successful in modern music history.</p>

    <p>Born in Liverpool, McCartney taught himself piano, guitar, and songwriting as a teenager, having been
        influenced by his father, a jazz player, and rock and roll performers such as Little Richard and Buddy
        Holly. He began his career when he joined Lennon's skiffle group, the Quarrymen, in 1957, which evolved into
        the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called "the cute Beatle", McCartney later immersed himself in the London
        avant-garde scene and played a key role in incorporating experimental aesthetics into the Beatles' studio
        productions. Starting with the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, he gradually became the
        band's de facto leader, providing creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. Many of his
        Beatles songs, including "And I Love Her", "Yesterday", "Eleanor Rigby", and "Blackbird", rank among the
        most covered songs in history. Although primarily a bassist with the Beatles, he played a number of
        other instruments, including keyboards, guitars, and drums, on various songs.</p>
