        <i><b>Yesterday</b> all my troubles seemed so far away.
            Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
            Oh, I believe in yesterday.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <i><b>Suddenly</b> I'm not half the man I used to be.
            There's a shadow hanging over me.
            Oh, yesterday came <b>suddenly</b>.</i>

        <i><b>Why</b> she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
            I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.</i>
