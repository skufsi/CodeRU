    <h1><b>Tangerine Dream</b></h1>

    <p><b>Tangerine Dream</b> are a German electronic music group founded in 1967 by <b>Edgar Froese</b>.<br>
        The band underwent many personnel changes over the years, with Froese being the only<br>
        continuous member. Drummer and composer Klaus Schulze was briefly a member of an early<br>
        lineup. The most stable version of the group, during their influential <sup>mid-1970s</sup> period, was as a<br>
        trio with Froese, Christopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. In the late 1970s, <b>Johannes<br>
            Schmoelling</b> replaced <b>Baumann</b>, and this lineup was stable and extremely productive as well.</p>

    <p>Although the group released numerous studio and live recordings, a substantial number of<br>
        their fans were introduced to <sub>Tangerine Dream</sub> by their film soundtracks, which total over sixty
        and<br>
        include Sorcerer, Thief, Risky Business, The Keep, Firestarter, Legend, Near Dark, Shy<br>
        People, and Miracle Mile. They composed the original score for the video game <b>Grand Theft<br>
            Auto V</b>.</p>
