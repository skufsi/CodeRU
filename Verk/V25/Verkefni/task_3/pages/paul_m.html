    <h1>Paul McCartney</h1>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney">Sir James Paul McCartney</a> (born 18 June 1942) is an
        English singer, songwriter and musician who gained worldwide
        fame with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">Beatles</a>, for whom he played bass guitar
        and the piano, and shared primary songwriting and lead vocal duties with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon">John Lennon</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed the Quarrymen,
        which evolved into the Beatles in 1960.
        Lennon initially was the group's de facto leader, a role he gradually seemed to cede to McCartney. Through his
        songwriting in the Beatles, he embraced
        myriad musical influences, initially writing and co-writing rock and pop-orientated hit songs in the band's
        early years, then later incorporating
        experimental elements into his compositions in the latter half of the Beatles' career as his songs became known
        for their increasing innovation</p>
